# fuzzy-phrase

`fuzzy-phrase` is planned to be a new fuzzy (and exact) phrase matching engine written in Rust that will eventually be wrapped into a Node.js module and incorporated into [carmen](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen). For now, it's a home for experimental code. More detailed docs will be added as the architecture of the library is developed.
